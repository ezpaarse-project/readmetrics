# Welcome to ReadMETRICS

ReadMETRICS is a new turnkey solution for:
- monitoring transformative agreements, including before and beyond; 
- analyzing usage across disciplines and consortia; 
- assessing value of publishing spend; 
- enabling comparative citation analysis. 

It is based on the already existing and field-tested [ezPAARSE](https://www.ezpaarse.org) and [ezMESURE](https://ezmesure.couperin.org) Free and Open Source tools, extending and including features inspired by the [National Library of Luxemburg](https://bnl.public.lu/fr/decouvrir/reseaux/consortium.html#) “New Metrics” project, described [here](https://www.consortium.lu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/new-metrics-v1.3.pdf).

## ezPAARSE
An open-source software that can ingest your (proxy) log files and show how users access subscribed electronic resources.
It filters, extracts and enriches the access events that were spotted and produces a result file that ezMESURE can ingest and display in a dashboard.

## ezMESURE
An open-source software built upon Elastic and Kibana to assemble a repository centralizing the usage statistics data produced by one or many instances of ezPAARSE. It is also able to ingest [COUNTER5](https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/abstract/) data.

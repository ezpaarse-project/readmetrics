# Welcome to ReadMETRICS

ReadMETRICS is a new turnkey solution for:
- monitoring transformative agreements, including before and beyond; 
- analyzing usage across disciplines and consortia; 
- assessing value of publishing spend; 
- enabling comparative citation analysis. 

It is based on the already existing and field-tested [ezPAARSE](https://www.ezpaarse.org) and [ezMESURE](https://ezmesure.couperin.org) Free and Open Source tools, extending and including features inspired by the National Library of Luxemburg “New Metrics” project.
